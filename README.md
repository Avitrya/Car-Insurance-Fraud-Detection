# Car-Insurance-Fraud-Detection
Among all kinds of fraud, insurance fraud is one the most damaging one that a company can face. According to National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), fraud is the second most costly white-collar crime in America behind tax evasion. The total cost of insurance fraud (non-health insurance) estimated to be more than $40 billion (â‚¹ 277902 crores) per year. In this project, we have chosen to work on Car Insurance Fraud, as already many credit card fraud detection solutions have sprung up, but very less of those are related to car insurance.
